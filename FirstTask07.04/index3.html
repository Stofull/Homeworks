        <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is HTML</h2>
    <div style="font-size: large;">
        <p><strong>Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</strong> 
            is the standard for creating web pages and web applications
        </p>
    <br>
        <p >Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <u>HTML</u> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
        <p ><u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. 
            With <u>HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded 
            into the rendered page. <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting 
            structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
            <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as 
            &lt;img /&gt;  and &lt;input /&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; 
            surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
            Browsers do not display the <u>HTML</u> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Markup</h1>
    <div style="font-size: large;">
         <p>
         <u>HTML</u> markup consists of several key components, including those 
            called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character 
            references and entity references. <u>HTML</u> tags most commonly come in pairs like 
            &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h1&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. 
            The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag 
            (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
        </p>
        <p>  
            Another important component is the <u>HTML</u> document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.
        </p>

            The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
        </p>
    </div>
    <pre style="background-color: rgb(141, 141, 141);">
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
        &lt;html>
              &lt;head>
                    &lt;title>This is a title&lt;title>
              &lt;head>
              &lt;body>
                     &lt;p>Hello world!&lt;/p>
              &lt;body>
        &lt;html>
    </pre>
